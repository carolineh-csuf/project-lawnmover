Project  - algorithm Implementation  

    The lawnmower algorithm and the alternate algorithm

Project Description:

This project aims to design and implement two algorithms as above to solve the alternative disk problem. The problem is defined as a list of disks of two colors - light and dark - in an alternate order starting with light and only allowing the interchange of the positions of two adjacent disks. The sorting result would be all the light disks to the left and all the dark disks to the right.

Technologies Used:

    C++, Git, Tuffix

Project Setup:

    clone the project from GitHub.

    navigate to the project file directory in your environment.  

    Run the Makefile to compile and execute to show the test result.
